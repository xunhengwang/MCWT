Morphological connectivity using wavelet transform

The goal of this research is to build novel morphological connectivity in the single subject level based on anatomical MRI. To this end, we developed a package to compute individual morphological connectivity using wavelet transform. The packge included preprocessing of anatomical MRI, VBM, wavelet transform of 3D MRI datasets, and morphological connectivity computation.
